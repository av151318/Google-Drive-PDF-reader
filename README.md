# Google-Drive-PDF-reader
Place google sheet into Google drive folder full of PDF's and run script.

This project was adapted from a project where my state job assignment 
was to parse data from a large folder of PDF's to organize Purchase Orders 
by quantifiers such as date, PO Number, Service Number, Price, Licesne Date

Project implements REGEX to find and Parse key datum from PDF's using google's OCR functions to read PDF's 

This code was largely adapted from the following article by Yagisanatode:
